A simple property search application built in react with the help of [Remix](https://remix.run/) and tested using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
This isn't obviously exhaustive but covers:

* Fundamental React "things"
* Integrating with a server to get SSR, data fetching and the whole application works without javascript! Accessibility ðŸš€
* An approach to styling using tailwind
* Automated testing

Stying isn't meant to be perfect, I'm no designer ðŸ™ˆ

## Running

`yarn` to install, `yarn dev` to run the app and `yarn test` to run all the tests/
